Besides, I have many other leisure-time hobbies, generally about contact with nature, including camping, astro observation, and traveling. I especially enjoy visiting local museums while traveling. Camping If not alone, camping is an activity that combines embracing nature and face-to-face social interactions. I immensely enjoy it. Together with friends, go to a pure nature world, feel the intermontane gentle breeze, and listen to the birds singing after working in the cities filled with artificialities for a long time.

In contrast, astrophiles visually observe the universe, which is quite intuitive. I enjoy looking up at the starry sky. The remote stars always inspire interesting and romantic imagination.

Through traveling, I can learn the diverse cultures and customs of different places while relaxing. Museums are good places to learn something new. I have visited many museums with various themes, including trains, aircraft, archaeology, etc. Mineral specimen, Musee HongHo PaiHo, Tianjin, September 2023 Me, Musee HongHo PaiHo, Tianjin, September 2023"},{"title":"archives","date":"2020-07-18T05:10:34.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.977Z","comments":true,"path":"archives/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/archives/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"分类","date":"2020-08-30T03:41:17.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.977Z","comments":true,"path":"categories/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/categories/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"contact","date":"2020-08-30T14:45:09.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.977Z","comments":true,"path":"contact/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/contact/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"友情链接","date":"2020-08-30T14:40:51.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.978Z","comments":true,"path":"friends/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/friends/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"友链","date":"2022-05-28T03:09:14.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.978Z","comments":true,"path":"link/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/link/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"","date":"2016-12-31T10:09:56.000Z","updated":"2016-12-31T10:09:56.000Z","comments":false,"path":"history/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/history/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"","date":"2017-02-24T09:37:05.000Z","updated":"2017-02-24T09:37:05.000Z","comments":true,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[{"title":"学术简历样本","slug":"academia-example","date":"2023-02-21T18:02:02.000Z","updated":"2024-10-15T20:52:58.861Z","comments":true,"path":"academia-example.html","link":"","permalink":"https://jikaisun.github.io/academia-example.html","excerpt":"","text":"About MeHi! I am Jikai Sun, a PhD student in Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My research interests revolve around Health Communication, especially the social and psychological factors that may influence the perception of health-related information on social media and the role of new media regarding this. More specifically, I am mostly interested in investigating the spreading mechanism of health misinformation and intervening approaches to combat it. As to research methods, I mainly use experiments and survey-based approaches to conduct my studies. Besides, I also care about other casual inference methods and computational methods. Now, I am a research assistant in the Computational Multi-Modal Communication Lab led by Cuihua Shen, Yilang Peng, and Yingdan Lu. I am now advised by Emily Vraga. I received my M.A. at the Renmin University of China. My advisor was Wenjing Pan then and we have collaborated on health misinformation research. I received my B.A. from Jinan University and was advised by Tao Liu. My academic works have been published in high-level journals, like Health Communication, Chinese Journal of Journalism &amp; Communication, and presented at international conferences, like the 73rd Annual ICA Conference and the SPSP 2021 Annual Convention.
